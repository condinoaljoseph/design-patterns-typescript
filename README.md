# Design Patterns in Typescript

Think of it as template for solving common issues in software development.

## Get Started

```bash
npm install -g typescript
npm install -g ts-node
```

Run examples via

```bash
ts-node ./src/PathToExample/Example.ts
```

Run tests via

```bash
npm run test
```

## Motivation

To write a resuable and extesible code. Might create a useful open-source library soon.
