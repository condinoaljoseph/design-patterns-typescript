# Strategy Pattern

The strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one as an object and make them interchangeable independently of the clients the use them.

This pattern allows us to add new functionality without refactoring the current code by adding or eliminating behaviours according to the business needs.

This pattern helps us to achieve two SOLID principle:

- **Single Responsibility** A class should have only one reason to be changed.
- **Open-Closed** Should be open for extension, but closed for modification
