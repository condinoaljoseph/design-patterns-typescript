# Command Pattern

Command is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or queue a requestâ€™s execution, and support [undoable](https://github.com/condinoaljoseph/design-patterns-typescript/blob/main/src/Command/Conceptual/undo.ts) operations.
